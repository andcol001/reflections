What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Git creates a .git directory as a sub-directory of the directory in which I initialised the repository. I need to this if I want to start tracking the history and contril versions of files in the repository

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

It is an intermediate area. You do not have direct access to this as you do to working director and repository. It allows you to group together changes files in a logical way so that you can do logically structures git commits from the working directory to the repository
