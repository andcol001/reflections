When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

As a backup of a local repository so that I can pull the remote to a different local machine to work or to collaborate with other team members so that we can push and pull our branches that we are working on independently.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

One can control at what point you want to pull / push changes according to when work is "finished". "Finished
 might be in the context of completting something that another team members needs for what he is working on or for a release version of you software for example. In automtic mode, one would not be able to control these logical synch points.
